# push_swap
The Push-Swap project from 42 Wolfsburg school

The project is about sorting numbers, only using 2 stacks, and some moves allowed.

My approach was using a quick sort algorithm, with more than 2 pivots, depending on the number of numbers, and then just move elements from one stack to another depending if the a numeber is smaller/greater than a pivot.

It is not an optimum algorithm, it will use approx 800-820 moves for 100 numbers, and an average of 8300 moves for 500 numebers.

It scored 86/125 on peer evaluation.

The code was rewrote to be according to the Norme, maximum 25 lines/function, max 80 columns/line, max 4 arguments/function, max 5 variables in a function, max 5 functions/file.
